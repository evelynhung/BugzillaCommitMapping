The script parse all commits and if one commit is solving the problem on the buglist, then we check its touched files.

- buglist: export this bugzilla query (http://mzl.la/1N7X7IV) as a json file (there is a 'REST' link in the bottom of result page)

- commits: generated by the following git command

`git whatchanged --topo-order --no-merges $commits.. -- tv_apps/ apps/sync/ shared/ build/ Makefile`
